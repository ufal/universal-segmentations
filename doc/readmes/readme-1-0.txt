# Universal Segmentations

## Introduction

Universal Segmentations (UniSegments) is a collection of lexical resources capturing morphological segmentations harmonised into a cross-linguistically consistent annotation scheme for many languages. The annotation scheme consists of simple tab-separated columns that stores a word and its morphological segmentations, including pieces of information about the word and the segmented units, e.g., part-of-speech categories, type of morphs/morphemes etc. The current public version of the collection contains 37 harmonised resources covering 26 different languages. For more details see [Universal Segmentations webpage](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/universal-segmentations).
